## Features

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) includes the following AI agents:

1.  **Pitch Deck Advisor (v1):**
    *   Upload existing pitch deck (PDF/PPTX - parsing is currently mocked).
    *   NLP analysis for clarity, conciseness, keyword density (via LLM).
    *   Compares structure against successful templates (general best practices).
    *   Provides actionable feedback points.
    *   Offers downloadable pitch deck templates (placeholder).
2.  **Financial Modeling Agent (v1):**
    *   Guided input for key financial assumptions.
    *   Generates basic 3-year Profit & Loss, Cash Flow, and Balance Sheet statements.
    *   Simple scenario analysis (e.g., +/- revenue sensitivity - UI placeholder).
    *   Excel export of financial models (logic implemented, UI placeholder).
3.  **Investor Scout (v1):**
    *   User inputs industry, stage, and desired investment range.
    *   Matches against a curated local CSV database (`data/investor_db.csv`).
    *   (Future: API integration with Crunchbase/PitchBook or LLM-enhanced matching).
4.  **Unified Dashboard (v1.0):**
    *   Integrates these agents, allows navigation, and shows status.

```

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ainvestor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Some dependencies in `requirements.txt` for file parsing (like `PyPDF2`, `python-pptx`) and testing (`pytest`) are commented out. Uncomment and install them if you plan to implement or run those specific parts.*

4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   Copy the example secrets file: `cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml` (if an example is provided) or create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
    *   Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your API keys for the LLM providers you intend to use (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Google, Groq, etc.). See the `SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS` dictionary in `core/llm_interface.py` for required secret names.
    *   Example for OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."`
    *   For Ollama, if it's not running on `http://localhost:11434`, set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in `secrets.toml`.

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from the project root directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should open in your default web browser.

## Configuration

### API Keys

API keys for LLM providers are managed via Streamlit's secrets mechanism. Store them in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`. This file should **not** be committed to version control if it contains real secrets.

### LLM Providers

The application uses Langchain to interact with various LLM providers. Supported providers and their configurations are defined in `core/llm_interface.py` in the `SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS` dictionary. Users can select their preferred provider and model through the UI on relevant pages (Pitch Deck Advisor, potentially others).

The `core/llm_interface.py` module also includes a function `get_available_models(provider_name)` which attempts to dynamically fetch model lists for configured providers. This functionality depends on the provider's API and correct API key setup.

## Development

### Core Principles

*   **Modularity:** UI (Streamlit pages) is kept separate from business logic (`core/` modules).
*   **Readability:** Clean, well-commented Python code (PEP 8).
*   **State Management:** `st.session_state` is used for managing state within Streamlit pages.
*   **Error Handling:** `try-except` blocks and user-friendly error messages (`st.error()`).
*   **Configuration:** `st.secrets` for sensitive data; constants or `config.py` for non-sensitive config.
*   **Reusability:** Common functions in `core/utils.py`.

Refer to `vision.md` for detailed implementation guidelines that were followed.

### Testing

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory and use `pytest`.
To run tests:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-mock # If not already installed
pytest
```
Tests primarily focus on the `core/` logic modules and `llm_interface.py`. Mocking is used for external API calls.
